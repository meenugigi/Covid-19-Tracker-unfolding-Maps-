This is a java applet that has been developed with the help of unfolding maps library and processing.
Unfolding maps is a library that helps create interactive maps and geo-visualizations.

Capabilities of this applet include:

- Shaded country areas on a world map depending on the number of confirmed covid-19 cases imported from a dataset.
- Hovering on a marker displays additional information like country name, population, total number of covid-19 cases and no of new cases.
- Displays dynamic latitude and longitude at the bottom of the screen.
- Clicking a particular marker hides all the other markers.
- Changes map providers using key board shortcuts. (Click 1 - 2 - 3 on your keyboard to see the magic!)
